# Cash_Register_FP

From [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/cash-register):

Design a cash register drawer function `checkCashRegister()` that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.

cid is a 2D array listing available currency.

The `checkCashRegister()` function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.

Return `{status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []}` if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.

Return `{status: "CLOSED", change: [...]}` with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.

Otherwise, return `{status: "OPEN", change: [...]}`, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.

| Unidad Monetaria | Cantidad |
|---|---|
| Penny | $0.01 (PENNY) |
| Nickel | $0.05 (NICKEL) |
| Dime | $0.1 (DIME) |
| Quarter | $0.25 (QUARTER) |
| Dollar | $1 (ONE) |
| Cinco D贸lares | $5 (FIVE) |
| Diez D贸lares | $10 (TEN) |
| Veinte D贸lares | $20 (TWENTY) |
| Cien D贸lares | $100 (ONE HUNDRED) |

See below for an example of a cash-in-drawer array:

```javascript
[
  ["PENNY", 1.01],
  ["NICKEL", 2.05],
  ["DIME", 3.1],
  ["QUARTER", 4.25],
  ["ONE", 90],
  ["FIVE", 55],
  ["TEN", 20],
  ["TWENTY", 60],
  ["ONE HUNDRED", 100]
]
```
